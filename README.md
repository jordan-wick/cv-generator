## Description

First react project, showcasing learning in the use of components and states.

## Improvement Opportunities

- More animations
- Minor UI changes in font decisions, colors, etc.
- Save & cancel buttons instead of just save
- Maintaining the aspect ration and sizing of the resume
- Adding print features to the resume to ensure it is the only thing in the print preview
  - It seems that the availability of features for making this work are limited in most browsers.
